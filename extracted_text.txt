Projects
IMDB Sentiment Classification using LSTM.
Jan’24
• Develop a simple single-layer LSTM model for the IMDB movie review sentiment classification. Accuracy 95.8% after 10
epochs.
• Extend the LSTM model with layer-wise & used dropout layer to reduce overfitting. Accuracy 94.8% after 10 epochs.
• Combine the spatial structure learning properties of a Convolutional Neural Network with the sequence learning of an
LSTM.Accuracy 98.3% after 10 epochs.
Loan Default Prediction Using Random Forest Classifier.
Oct’23
• Developed a model using Random Forest to predict loan default risk and assess creditworthiness for loan applicants.
• Activities: Data Preprocessing, RandomForest Classification model, EDA
• Validation models: 5-fold cross-validation, train and test split.Average 5-fold cross-validation score 88.5%.
• Find accuracy score: 94.8% for train and 88.5% for test. Tools: Python, Machine Learning, Random Forest.
Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM.
Mar’24
• Develop a three-layer LSTM model and one-layer Dense for the Axis Bank stock price prediction, Utilized data analysis
and machine learning to predict the next 30 days’ stock price.
• Import Axis bank data from Yahoo Finance. Achieving a significant reduction in mean squared error loss.
• Accuracy: Performance root mean square error, for train 140.99 and test 640.37.
• Validation models: Train and test split, K-fold cross-validation use for reduce overfitting the model.
Student Database Create and Management. (SQL Project)
Apr’24
• We created a student database from scratch, including table creation and data insertion. We joined two tables using
common attributes and performed update and delete tasks, as well as applied aggregation functions.

Machine Learning/Deep Learning for Crypto Intern
Delhi
Guide: Scientist S.P. Mishra, ’G’.
• Explored vulnerabilities of the 10-round(128-bit keys) Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptosystem through
side-channel attacks using power consumption data.
• Applied various Machine Learning/Deep Learning models to predict the hamming weight of first 8-bit cipher text after
XOR with key and s-box performed. Our next step is to predict a 128-bit key using a multiclass classification approach.
• Achieved a 63.9% accuracy rate using XgBoost in predicting the hamming weight of the first 8-bit data, outperforming
Logistic Regression (44.2%), Random Forest (47.9%), and ANN (43.95%).
